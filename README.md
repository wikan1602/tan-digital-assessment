# Data Engineer Technical Assessment - TAN Digital

## Overview
This repository contains my submission for the Data Engineer Technical Assessment. The solution covers end-to-end data engineering tasks including Database Schema Design, SQL Analysis, ETL Pipeline development using Python, and Business Intelligence Dashboard creation.

> ** Important Note on Data Timeline:**
> To ensure data relevance and integrity during the assessment, I standardized the mock data timeline to **Year 2025** across all modules. Consequently, all SQL queries filter for the year 2025 instead of the original requirement (2023) to match the generated dataset.
